# REQUIREMENTS
so we are planning to design a calculator with some basic operations
## Tools: we are goind to use vs code for compiling and also for pushing it into GitHub
Description
# Simple Basic Calculator
## Introduction: -
•	Simple Calculator helps users to calculate simple calculations with great speed and accessibility. Simple calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic four operations in mathematics, they are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. But in this Project also included three additional operations such as square, square root, cube of given number. However, the input has to be in the form "number1 operator1 number2 "(i.e., 2+4).
•	The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition, we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works. Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division/subtraction

# REQUIREMENTS
## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
|S.NO|DESCRIPTION |Category|Status|
|:----| ----------------------:|--------:|---------:|
|HR01|User should be able to view operation list|Technical|Implemented|
|HR02|User should be able to select the operation from the given list|Technical|Implemented|
|HR03|The system should able to perform the given operation|Technical|Implemented|
|HR04|The system should provide correct result|Technical|Implemented|
## LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
|S.NO|DESCRIPTION |Category|Status|
|:----| ----------------------:|--------:|---------:|
|LR01|If the calculations are impossible the calculator has to display information helping the user to resolve the erroneous situation|Technical|Implemented|
|LR02|On encountering a division by 0 the display should read "Cannot divide by 0" and typing the key “C” should reset the calculator|Technical|Implemented|
|LR03|On calculating the square root value of a negative operand, the display should read "Wrong operand"|Technical|Implemented|
## SWOT ANALYSIS
###### STRENGTHS
The ultimate strength of Calculators is its innovative, user-friendly and long lasting etc.
###### WEAKNESSES
Do not include all the operations rather have only addition, subtraction multiplication, division, square, square root and cube.
###### OPPORTUNITIES
There is a huge opportunity in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than other
###### THREATS
The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.

## 5W's and 1H's
